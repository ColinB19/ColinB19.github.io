## nbextenstions
`$ pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`
or 
`$ conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`
then
`$ jupyter contrib nbextension install --user`

## A nice dark mode:
`$ pip install jupyterthemes`
`$ pip install --upgrade jupyterthemes`

`$ jt -t monokai`


I got this from [here](https://medium.com/@rbmsingh/making-jupyter-dark-mode-great-5adaedd814db).
`$ jt -t monokai -f fira -fs 13 -nf ptsans -nfs 11 -N -kl -cursw 5 -cursc r -cellw 95% -T`
add 

```python 
from jupyterthemes import jtplot
jtplot.style(theme=’monokai’, context=’notebook’, ticks=True, grid=False)
```
to your notebook to get plots to work right.
