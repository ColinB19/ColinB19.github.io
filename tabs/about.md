I am a recent graduate from the University of Nevada, Reno with a M.S. in Physics. I am currently seeking a job in the private sector as a Data Scientist. Aside from physics and data science I enjoy hiking, watching and playing sports, and traveling! My less athletic interests include reading fantasy and sci-fi novels, playing card games and video games. I plan on creating a separate blog in the future on these topics!

## Physics Background

>  During my undergraduate degree, along side my rigorous course work in mathematics and physics, I contributed to a group attempting to search for dilatonic dark matter using interferometric cavity spacers. I continued this research into graduate school where my group proposed the use of the GPS constellation to detect exotic low-mass scalar fields (ELFs). This research culminated in several papers published in high-profile journals (please see my resum&eacute; for a list of publications). During my graduate education I discovered an unconscious shift in my thinking toward data. Our group used a fairly large, messy data set and I discovered that exploring the data set was equally as engaging as discussing the physics associated with the phenomena with which we were concerned. This was the inception of my data science career!

Please feel free to explore my website! I will post fairly regularly on both my journey through data science and some physics concepts I would like to shed light on. Thanks for the visit!
